# Projet_Skin_cancer
In our skin disease deep learning project, we implemented the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) layer to enhance both Channel Attention and Spatial Attention mechanisms within our neural network architecture. The incorporation of CBAM has proven instrumental in capturing intricate features associated with skin diseases by effectively recalibrating channel-wise and spatial-wise information. This augmentation has significantly bolstered the model's ability to focus on relevant regions while suppressing irrelevant ones, ultimately leading to a more discriminative representation of skin lesions. To further optimize the training process, we adopted a reduced learning rate strategy and employed the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer. This meticulous tuning of hyperparameters has yielded remarkable results, as evidenced by the achieved accuracy of 93%. The combination of CBAM integration and thoughtful parameter adjustments showcases the potential for improved diagnostic performance in our skin disease classification model.
